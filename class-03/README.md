## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing Lecture 3 of Code 201, students will:

- Demonstrate understanding of and classify assorted control flow techniques in JavaScript including ‘for’ loops, ‘if’ and if/else’, as well as  ‘while’ and ‘do/while’ structures, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate understanding of arrays measured by an ability to write array literals and access the values stored in them from their index in lab
- Demonstrate understanding of and explain what HTML element attributes are and how to use them, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate understanding of and illustrate the CSS box model, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas

## Code Review

Let's take about 30 minutes to do our code review session. We're going to look at someone's code, have students read through it and explain it, take questions, and so on. Code review is an important part of professional development processes and also a key part of our learning environment in this course.
